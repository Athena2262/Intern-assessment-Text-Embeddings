# Project Documentation: Text Embeddings with BERT and Word2Vec

## Overview

This documentation presents two projects focusing on extracting embeddings from text data using state-of-the-art models: BERT and Word2Vec (GloVe). These embeddings serve as dense vector representations capturing semantic meanings of words and sentences, enabling various downstream NLP tasks.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This documentation covers two projects: embedding text data into vector representations using the BERT model for CSV files and the Word2Vec model for JSON files.

## 2. CSV Embedding <a name="csv-embedding"></a>

### 2.1 Project Overview <a name="csv-project-overview"></a>

The CSV embedding project aims to utilize the BERT model for embedding textual data stored in CSV format. BERT provides contextualized word embeddings by considering the entire input text.

### 2.2 Dataset <a name="csv-dataset"></a>

The dataset consists of textual information stored in a CSV file. Each row contains text data for embedding.

### 2.3 Model <a name="csv-model"></a>

The BERT model, specifically the 'bert-base-uncased' variant, is employed for tokenization and embedding.

### 2.4 Processing and Embedding <a name="csv-processing-and-embedding"></a>

Textual data from the CSV file is tokenized using the BERT tokenizer. The tokens are then passed through the BERT model to obtain embeddings. The final embeddings are generated by averaging the hidden states.

### 2.5 Saving Embeddings <a name="csv-saving-embeddings"></a>

The generated embeddings are saved in a CSV-compatible format for later retrieval and usage in downstream tasks.

### 2.6 Usage <a name="csv-usage"></a>

To utilize the BERT embeddings for CSV data:

- Provide the path to the CSV file containing the dataset.
- Ensure the required dependencies, including the transformers library, are installed.
- Run the code to generate and save embeddings.
- Retrieve the saved embeddings as needed.

## 3. JSON Embedding <a name="json-embedding"></a>

### 3.1 Project Overview <a name="json-project-overview"></a>

The JSON embedding project focuses on extracting embeddings from text data stored in JSON format using the Word2Vec model.

### 3.2 Dataset <a name="json-dataset"></a>

The dataset is stored in a JSON file, where various fields contain text data for embedding.

### 3.3 Model <a name="json-model"></a>

The Word2Vec model, specifically the pre-trained GloVe embeddings, is utilized for generating word embeddings.

### 3.4 Processing and Embedding <a name="json-processing-and-embedding"></a>

Textual data from the JSON file is processed, and tokens are obtained. Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings are then loaded, and tokens are mapped to their corresponding embeddings.

### 3.5 Saving Embeddings <a name="json-saving-embeddings"></a>

The generated embeddings are saved in a JSON-compatible format for later retrieval and usage in downstream tasks.

### 3.6 Usage <a name="json-usage"></a>

To utilize the Word2Vec embeddings for JSON data:

- Provide the path to the JSON file containing the dataset.
- Ensure the required dependencies, including the gensim library, are installed.
- Run the code to generate and save embeddings.
- Retrieve the saved embeddings as needed.

## 4. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In conclusion, both projects offer solutions for embedding textual data into dense vector representations, facilitating various natural language processing tasks.
